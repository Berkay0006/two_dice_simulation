Two_dice _simulation: 

The program simulates two rolling dice by using programming C, and so it can generate random numbers. 
The program begins by initializing an array that will count how many times each possible sum from 2 to 12, can occur.
Then it performs 50,000 simulated dice rolls by generating two random numbers between 1 and 6. 
For each dice roll, it ass the two values and increases the counter for that specific sum in the array. 
After all the rolls are completed, the program prints how many times each sum has appeared. 
In this way, the program will show the distribution of the sums of the two dice.
